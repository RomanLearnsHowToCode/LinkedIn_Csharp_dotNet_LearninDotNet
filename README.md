- Test-Driven Development
st-driven development is one of the more popular ways of programming to catch bugs early and keep code very testable.
It's a process that uses uniTEST to guide the code design of your applications. Related to this process is an approach
called Red, Green, Refactor. Red is where you create tests to purposefully fail, to make sure that your testing code will
actually catch failed tests. Green is to update those test cases to make them pass, and see that they actually do work.
And Refactor is to clean up your code, and then ideally, retest.
